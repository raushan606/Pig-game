        <p id="text">Hello Everyone,<br>
        Here I coded a game called Pig Game. You can play and enjoy it.<br />
            There are some certain rules of this game : <br>
            -> The game has 2 players, playing in rounds. <br>
            -> A player looses his ENTIRE score when he rolls two 6 in a row. After that, it's the next player's turn. <br>
            -> Players can set the winning score, so that they can change score. <br>
            -> The player looses his current score when one of them is a 1.
            
            
            
            
            </p>
    </div>
